# js-gui-pwa-fact

> Progressive web apps (PWA) are responsive, fast, available offline, and allow your users to install them on their mobile devices - just add icons, manifest.json, and service-worker.js.

## Links

- [Demo](https://denisecase.github.io/js-gui-pwa-fact/)
- [Source](https://github.com/denisecase/js-gui-pwa-fact)

## Requirements

- A browser (e.g., Firefox or Chrome)
- A text editor (e.g., VS Code or Notepad++, or Chrome)
- A favorite API (a service that will respond to requests)
- Host the site with [VS Code Live Server Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or [Web Server for Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb) (or view the [Demo](https://denisecase.github.io/js-gui-pwa-fact/))

## IMPORTANT! Serve the app to use fetch

We can't serve our website as a local file and use fetch, so we must host the app locally with either VS Code Live Server or Web Server for Chrome Extension.

## Serving with VS Code Live Server

After installing the VS Code Live Server, open the folder in VS Code, right-click index.html and select "Open with Live Server".

## App to PWA

- Create manifest.json to provide information about your app.
- Create favicons and a full set of icons (users can install a PWA on their devices)
- Create service-worker.js
- Add index.html links and icons to manifest.json
- Add index.html script to register a service worker running independently, capable of intercepting all fetch requests and adjusting for offline, caching, and more

## Creating PWA Icons

PWA can be installed. We need a lot of icons to handle all different devices.

### 1. Create Initial Favicons

Basic icon built with [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io)

- Text: Fact
- Background: Rounded
- Font family: Leckerli One
- Font size: 44
- Color: #FFF
- Background: #006747

Download and save/expand zipfile in images folder.

### 2. Create Set of PWA Icons

Full set of PWA icons built with [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/).  Upload one of your large favicons and update settings. Make sure first radio button (... for Web, Android, Microsoft, iOS...) is checked. Download and save the zipfile to images folder. Extract.

Update icons property in manifest.json as needed (if the names are the same, it can be reused from a reference project).

### 3. Create Additional Android Icons (optional)

Then, generate a few additional icons for use on Android devices.
